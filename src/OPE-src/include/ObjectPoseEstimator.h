/**
 * \brief Performs object pose estimation using the parametric superquadric shape model
 * \details Superquadrics are a family of parametric shapes that include superellipsoids, 
 * supertoroids, and superhyperboloids with one and two parts. They are appealing for 
 * robotic applications by nature of their definition. We focus on the superellipsoid which 
 * is useful for a volumetric part-based description. Given the parameters that define a 
 * superquadric, the shape and pose information can be easily extracted as well as volumes 
 * and moments of inertia. They are compact in shape and have a closed surface. Moreover, 
 * superquadrics exhibit tri-axis symmetry, which is a characteristic well approximated by 
 * many household objects.
 *
 * Superquadrics can be defined in an object centered coordinate system with five variables 
 * and in a general coordinate system by eleven independent variables. The variables 
 * \f$ a_1, a_2, a_3 \f$ are the scaling dimensions along the x, y, and z 
 * axes of the superquadric, \f$ e1, e2 \f$ are the factors which determine the 
 * superquadric's shape ranging from from 0.1 to 1, and 
 * \f$ (n_x, n_y, n_z, o_x, o_y, o_z, a_x, a_y, a_z, p_x, p_y, p_z) \f$ are the twelve parameters 
 * of the homogeneous transformation matrix that is a result of a rotation and translation 
 * of the world coordinate frame.
